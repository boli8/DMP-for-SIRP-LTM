# Dynamic message-passing for inference and mitigation of infection-induced cascades

This repository contains codes for algorithms developed in the work *"Infection-induced Cascading Failures -- Impact and Mitigation"* by Bo Li and David Saad, Communications Physics volume 7, Article number: 144 (2024).

The codes are written in Julia. They were last tested on Julia v1.10.0.

## Usage

Run the script named ``to_explore_xx.jl`` for each specific case.

## Remark

The codes are not optimized for best performance.

## Citation

Please cite the following paper if the algorithm helps your research
