# Bilevel message-passing for flow network optimization
This repository contains codes for algorithms developed in the work *"Infection-induced Cascading Failures -- Impact and Mitigation"* by Bo Li and David Saad, arXiv:2307.16767 (2023).

The codes are written in Julia. They were last tested on Julia v1.10.0.

## Usage
Run the script named ```to_explore_xx.jl``` for each specific case.

## Remark
The codes are not optimized for best performance.

## Citation
Please cite the following paper if the algorithm helps your research
